                <b>We reclaim your rights over the Web. </b> Being involved in the tech world, we noticed how people,
                including
                ourselves, started to feel like there´s no control over what happens with our data. As sharing our data
                has
                become a requirement for anyone who wants to enjoy the internet, we decided it was time to make data
                rights
                accessible to everyone. This is why we founded re:claim to build a new future of data ownership that
                gives users
                transparency and choice over the data they share online.
